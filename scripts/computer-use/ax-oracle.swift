// An accessibility oracle that owes Computer Use nothing.
//
// Every real-machine check so far read the result back through the same path
// that wrote it: the model acts through maka-cu, and then the observation
// that says it worked also comes from maka-cu. An executor that reports a
// successful click on a control it never touched passes that test. So does a
// locked screen, which is how a menu-only tree once read as a normal one.
//
// This walks the accessibility tree itself, through the system framework, in a
// separate process. When it and an observation disagree, the observation is
// the one that has to explain itself.
//
// Usage:
//   swift scripts/computer-use/ax-oracle.swift <bundle-id> [--role AXButton] [--depth 8]
// Prints one JSON object: the app, its windows, and every element with a role,
// a label, and a value. Exit 0 means the object describes the tree. Exit 1
// means it describes why there is no tree to describe — `screen_locked`,
// `not_permitted`, `not_running` — and the caller must not read the absence of
// an element as evidence the element is absent. Exit 64 is a usage error.
//
// This is a hand-run tool. It has no automated caller in this repository: it is
// meant to be run beside a Computer Use session, by a person, when an
// observation needs a second opinion.
