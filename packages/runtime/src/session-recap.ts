Lead with agency, phrased naturally in that language: if the session was mainly questions or review with no landed change, open by referencing what the user asked (the equivalent of "You asked ..."); if the agent landed changes, reference what was done (the equivalent of "We fixed/added/wired ..."); if almost nothing happened, say in that language that the session had just begun.
